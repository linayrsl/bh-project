# Family Tree Project

## Run Project In Production Environment

### Database

A Postgres database is required with two tables:

`verification_codes` table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS verification_codes (
    email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    verification_code VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    attempts INT DEFAULT(0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT(now() at time zone 'utc')
);
```

`family_tree_upload_log` table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS family_tree_upload_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email character varying NOT NULL,
    gedcom_language character varying(2) NOT NULL,
    creation_time timestamp with time zone,
    num_of_people integer,
    num_of_photos integer,
    is_new_tree boolean,
    gedcom_url character varying(2048)
    CONSTRAINT fk_email
      FOREIGN KEY(email) 
	  REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

`users` table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
(
    email character varying(256) NOT NULL,
    first_name character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    last_name character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    address character varying(1024) NOT NULL,
    city character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    zip character varying(64) NOT NULL,
    country character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    phone character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (email)
);
```

The application does not support automatic migrations so the database schema should be ready before running the application.

### Docker Images


#### Web Server

Build Docker image for web server:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t bh-project:latest .
```

This is a web server process. See `Environment Variables` section for configuration information.

#### Weekly Submissions Report

Build Docker image for weekly report job:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t bh-project-weekly-report:latest .
```

This container should be scheduled to run automatically once a week.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run containers:

* `PORT` - Port number for web server to accept connections inside docker container. For example if you map port `80` on host to port `3000` in container you should set `PORT=3000` 
* `DATABASE_URL` - Connection string to the project's Postgres database. Example: "postgres://db_user:db_password@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/bh-project".
* `ACTIVETRAIL_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for ActiveTrail API. Example: "https://webapi.mymarketing.co.il".
* `ACTIVETRAIL_API_KEY` - ActiveTrail API key.
* `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Sendgrid API key.
* `GEDCOM_EMAIL_FROM` - Email address that will appear in "From" field of the email with Gedcom attachment sent with Sendgrid and in an email with verification code.
* `GEDCOM_EMAIL_TO` - A comma-separated list of recipient email addresses for the email with Gedcom attachment. Example: "email1@bh.org.il,email2@bh.org.il".
* `REPORT_EMAIL_FROM` - Email address that will appear in "From" field of the email with weekly family-tree submissions CSV report sent with Sendgrid.
* `REPORT_EMAIL_TO` - A comma-separated list of recipient email addresses for the email with weekly family-tree submissions CSV report.

Optional environment variables:

* `LOGGLY_CUSTOMER_TOKEN` - Customer token for [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/) account to receive all application logs.
